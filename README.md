# Real Estate Listings Scraper

## Overview
This script is a web scraper designed to extract real estate listings from publicly available web pages. It uses Puppeteer with stealth plugins to minimize detection and ensure smooth scraping. The extracted data includes:

- **Price**
- **Address**
- **Number of Beds**
- **Number of Baths**
- **Square Footage**
- **Lot Size**
- **Listing Link**

The results are saved in a structured JSON format (`scrapedData.json`) for easy use in data analysis or real estate market research.

## Features
âœ… Uses Puppeteer Extra with stealth plugins for improved anonymity.  
âœ… Implements randomized user agents to mimic human behavior.  
âœ… Introduces delays and scrolling to reduce detection risks.  
âœ… Extracts structured real estate data dynamically.  
âœ… Saves the scraped data in a JSON file for further processing.  
âœ… Configurable target URL through environment variables for flexibility.
